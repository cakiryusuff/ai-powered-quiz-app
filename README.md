# AI-Powered Quiz App

This is an AI-powered quiz application developed using **Streamlit**, **Pydantic AI agents**, and **Pydantic**. The app dynamically generates questions based on a given quiz text and evaluates user answers in real-time. The answers are compared using AI-powered agents that provide feedback and scoring.

## Features

- **Dynamic Question Generation**: AI agents generate questions from a given text (e.g., a PDF). The questions include multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and classic question types.

- **AI-Powered Scoring**: The user's answers are evaluated using **Pydantic AI agents**, which compare the user's response to the correct answer and provide a score out of 10. The comparison allows partial credit for close answers, especially for non-numeric or non-factual responses.

- **Real-Time Feedback**: Immediate feedback is provided after the user submits each answer, showing whether the answer is correct or incorrect along with the corresponding score.

- **Flexible Question Types**: The app supports three types of questions:
  - **Multiple-Choice (MCQ)**
  - **Fill-in-the-Blank (FITB)**
  - **Classic (Open-ended) Questions**

- **Customizable Number of Questions**: The user can specify how many questions they want to answer, and the app will generate and display questions accordingly.

- **Session Management**: Tracks the userâ€™s progress throughout the quiz and shows the cumulative score as they answer each question.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: A framework for building interactive web applications.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and structuring user inputs and outputs.
- **Pydantic AI Agents**: For generating dynamic questions and comparing answers.
- **Python 3.8+**: The programming language used for the development.
- **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables, such as API keys for external services like OpenAI.
